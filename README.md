# Negadras

This repository contains code for a flutter client of a business reviewing and finding application, much like Yelp. The backend written in javascript the implements a RESTful API can be found [here](https://github.com/Aymen-Mohammednur/Negadras-Backend "Negadras Backend Link"). 

It allows users to search, review, and discover new businesses, and lets them make well informed decisions on the places they plan to spend their time and money. business owners will also be able to extract value from this program.

### How to run
A web version has been ported and deployed. Please note that this does not mirror the performance or user experience one would get with an Android or iOS device. Some artifacts may also appear as the codebase was developed with mobile devices in mind. With all that said, the web version of the client can be found [here](https://stark-brushlands-69254.herokuapp.com/ "Negadras Backend Link"). 

To run the client locally, do the following:
1. Clone this repository.
2. `fluter pub get`
3. `flutter run`

Note that this will automatically connect to the backend hosted on herokuapp. If you want to host a local instance of the backend, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Aymen-Mohammednur/Negadras-Backend "Negadras Backend Link").
