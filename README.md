# Negadras

This repository contains code for a flutter client of a business reviewing and finding application, much like Yelp. The backend written in javascript the implements a RESTful API can be found [here](https://github.com/Aymen-Mohammednur/Negadras-Backend "Negadras Backend Link"). 

It allows users to search, review, and discover new businesses, and lets them make well informed decisions on the places they plan to spend their time and money. business owners will also be able to extract value from this program.
